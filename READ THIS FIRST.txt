The program/file names are as follows (sorry for the confusing names, didn't have time to change them)

randMatrix.cpp (randMatrix.exe) is the program used to generate random augmented matrix of a linear system.

serial is the implementation of the LU Factorization recursive algorithm (which was unused in the project report as I decided to focus on the different between a serial and parallel version of QR Factorization because processing time of the two serial algorithms was extremely long)

parallel.cpp (parallel.exe) is the serial implementation of the QR Factorization algorithm

main.cu (CUDAMatrixSolver.exe) is the CUDA accelerated version of the QR Factorization algorithm

These programs where designed to be run on Windows with the .exe. I do not think these will be able to be compiled or run on the Linux servers
